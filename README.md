    Name of the Game (Project): Wasteland Wanderer

    Premise:
        A lone wanderer in a post-apocalyptic wasteland searches for a legendary artifact hidden deep within the ruins of the old world. The player must survive the harsh environment, fend off dangerous mutants and raiders, and find the artifact before it’s too late. The artifact is said to have the power to restore hope to humanity, but its location is shrouded in mystery. The player’s goal is to find it and survive the nightmarish landscape.

    Characters:
        The Wanderer (Player Character): A resilient survivor equipped with basic weapons (crowbar, pistol, shotgun). The wanderer must navigate dangerous terrain and fight off enemies to achieve their goal of finding the artifact.
        Mutants: Deadly creatures that roam the wasteland. They are stronger and more aggressive at night.
        Raiders: Human bandits that will attack anyone on sight, looking to loot and survive.
        The Overseer: A mysterious figure who gives the player basic quests and information about the artifact, but may have their own agenda.

    Actions and Consequences:
        Combat: Players can engage in melee or ranged combat, using weapons like a crowbar (melee) or a pistol (ranged). Killing enemies will drop ammo or new weapons to help the player survive.
        Looting: Players can loot ammo and new weapons (e.g., a shotgun or crossbow) from enemies or hidden areas. Finding a new weapon makes combat easier, but players must manage their ammo carefully.
        Day-Night Cycle: During the day, enemies are fewer and weaker. At night, mutants become more aggressive, and raiders increase in numbers. Players must survive through the night, which creates urgency and challenges.
        Survival Mechanics: The player needs to manage resources, primarily ammo. Running out of ammo or weapons forces the player to rely on melee combat, making certain areas much harder.
        Simple Quests: The player receives basic objectives, such as "Clear the area of mutants" or "Find a weapon to proceed." The goal is always to make progress toward the artifact, but survival is the immediate concern.

    Base of the 2D Game Already in the Repo:
        A top-down, 2D view where players can move around the map, interact with enemies, and find new items.
        A combat system where the player can switch between melee and ranged attacks.
        Basic enemy AI that allows mutants to chase the player and raiders to either patrol or attack when in range.
        Inventory system to manage weapons and ammo.
        A day-night cycle with different challenges depending on the time of day.

Summary:

This game is focused on survival and combat in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The premise is simple: the player is a wanderer searching for an artifact to restore hope to the world, facing off against dangerous enemies and surviving harsh conditions. Looting is simplified to just ammo and weapons, and the day-night cycle adds an extra layer of strategy by making enemies more dangerous at night.

The character progression involves finding new weapons, managing resources, and fighting enemies while following simple quests to advance. The game keeps things beginner-friendly by avoiding complex systems like crafting and focusing on core mechanics that can be built up over time.
